		{Intel Platform Provisioning Framework}
		{IPPF}
		{private source}
		{2006}
		{
			IPPF provides baremetal provisioning through a set of tools and services.  It included automation to build and maintain a custom pre-boot OS that would communicate with IPPF getting build directives that enabled the bootstrapping of the targe build (Windows, Linux, even Solaris and HPUX in the early days). 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item {Originally developed in Java it was later ported to C\#}		
				\item {With the combination of the IPPF preboot-OS and the IPPF workflow engine users were able to create workflows to solve complex use cases}				
				\item {It is still in use today}
